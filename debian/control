Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, glmark2-data (= ${source:Version})
Description: OpenGL 2.0 benchmark suite
 glmark2 is a benchmark for OpenGL 2.0. It uses only the subset of
 the OpenGL 2.0 API that is compatible with OpenGL ES 2.0.
 glmark2 offers a suite of scenes that can be used to measure many
 aspects of OpenGL (ES) 2.0 performance.
 The way in which each scene is rendered is configurable through a set
 of options.
